This repository complements an academic report titled "Image colourisation" that I submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. The report describes an analysis of a fully automatic approach to image colourisation - the process used to add colour to a greyscale image - based on an unconstrained optimisation algorithm. The repository includes the following files:

1. `Colourisation.m`, a MATLAB GUI used to test and implement the method.
2. `main.m`, the base code with comments.
3. `col2grey.m`, an auxiliary function.

Note that there is an issue with the button for radial basis function, which needs to be pressed twice before compiling with the Gaussian function.
